# Homework Instructions
 
These are the __instructions__ for the individual homework assignments for IDS 2021.

If you are looking for the GitHub repository that contains the starter documents to work on and submit your assignment, please look for a repo in the [ids-s1-21 GitHub Organisation](https://github.com/ids-s1-21) with your username (e.g. hw-00-pet-names-eldave93). If this repo does not exist, please read and complete the "Prerequisites" section of the [HW00 instructions](https://example.com).
