In this two part assignment you get to review modeling and inference and also review two projects from your peers!

# Part 1 - General Social Survey

The GSS gathers data on contemporary American society in order to monitor and explain trends and constants in attitudes, behaviours, and attributes.
Hundreds of trends have been tracked since 1972.
In addition, since the GSS adopted questions from earlier surveys, trends can be followed for up to 70 years.

The GSS contains a standard core of demographic, behavioural, and attitudinal questions, plus topics of special interest.
Among the topics covered are civil liberties, crime and violence, intergroup tolerance, morality, national spending priorities, psychological well-being, social mobility, and stress and traumatic events.

In this assignment we analyze data from the 2016 GSS, using it to estimate values of population parameters of interest about US adults.[^1]
We will work with the following packages.
They should already be installed in your project, and you can load them with the following:

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(dsbox)
```

The dataset we will use is called `gss16` and it's in the `dsbox` package.

## Scientific research

In this section we're going to build a model to predict whether someone agrees or doesn't agree with the following statement:

> Even if it brings no immediate benefits, scientific research that advances the frontiers of knowledge is necessary and should be supported by the federal government.

The responses to the question on the GSS about this statement are in the `advfront` variable.

```{marginfigure}
It's important that you don't recode the NAs, just the remaining levels.
```

1.  Re-level the `advfront` variable such that it has two levels: `"Strongly agree"` and `"Agree"` combined into a new level called `"Agree"` and the remaining levels (except `NA`s) combined into `"Not agree"`. Then, re-order the levels in the following order: `"Agree"` and `"Not agree"`. Finally, `count()` how many times each new level appears in the `advfront` variable.

```{marginfigure}
You can do this in various ways. One option is to use the `str_detect()` function to detect the existence of words like liberal or conservative. Note that these sometimes show up with lowercase first letters and sometimes with upper case first letters. To detect either in the `str_detect()` function, you can use "[Ll]iberal" and "[Cc]onservative". But feel free to solve the problem however you like, this is just one option!
```

2.  Combine the levels of the `polviews` variable such that levels that have the word "liberal" in them are lumped into a level called `"Liberal"` and those that have the word "conservative" in them are lumped into a level called `"Conservative"`.
    Then, re-order the levels in the following order: `"Conservative"` , `"Moderate"`, and `"Liberal"`.
    Finally, `count()` how many times each new level appears in the `polviews` variable.

3.  Create a new data frame called `gss16_advfront` that includes the variables `advfront`, `educ`, `polviews`, and `wrkstat`.
    Then, use the `drop_na()` function to remove rows that contain `NA`s from this new data frame.

```{marginfigure}
Use the specific names given to make it easier to follow the rest of the instructions.
```

4.  Split the data into training (75%) and testing (25%) data sets. Make sure to set a seed before you do the `initial_split()`. Call the training data `gss16_train` and the testing data `gss16_test`.

```{marginfigure}
We'll create one more recipe later, that's why we're naming this recipe `_1`.
```

5.  Create a recipe with the following steps for predicting `advfront` from `polviews`, `wrkstat`, and `educ`.
    Name this recipe `gss16_rec_1`.

    -   `step_other()` to pool values that occur less than 10% of the time in the `wrkstat` variable into `"Other"`.

    -   `step_dummy()` to create dummy variables for `all_nominal()` variables that are predictors, i.e. `all_predictors()`

6.  Specify a logistic regression model using `"glm"` as the engine.
    Name this specification `gss16_spec`.

7.  Build a workflow that uses the recipe you defined (`gss16_rec`) and the model you specified (`gss16_spec`).
    Name this workflow `gss16_wflow_1`.

8.  Perform 5-fold cross validation.
    Specifically,

    -   split the training data into 5 folds (don't forget to set a seed first!),

    -   apply the workflow you defined earlier to the folds with `fit_resamples()`,

    -   `collect_metrics()` and comment on the consistency of metrics across folds (you can get the area under the ROC curve and the accuracy for each fold by setting `summarize = FALSE` in `collect_metrics()`),

    -   and report the average area under the ROC curve and the accuracy for all cross validation folds `collect_metrics()`.

9.  Now, try a different, simpler model: predict `advfront` from only `polviews` and `educ`.
    Specifically,

    -   update the recipe to reflect this simpler model specification (and name it `gss16_rec_2`),

    -   redefine the workflow with the new recipe (and name this new workflow `gss16_wflow_2`),

    -   perform cross validation,

    -   and report the average area under the ROC curve and the accuracy for all cross validation folds `collect_metrics()`.

<!-- -->

10. Comment on which model performs better (one including `wrkstat`, model 1, or the one excluding `wrkstat`, model 2) on the training data based on area under the ROC curve.

```{marginfigure}
__Note:__ If you haven't yet done so, you'll need to first train your workflows on the training data, and then use these fit objects to calculate predictions for the test data.
```

11. Use the models to predict the test data, calculate the accuracy, plot the ROC curves for the predictions for both models, and calculate the areas under the ROC curve. Does your answer to the previous exercise hold for the testing data as well? Explain your reasoning.

## Harassment at work

In 2016, the GSS added a new question on harassment at work.
The question is phrased as the following.

> Over the past five years, have you been harassed by your superiors or co-workers at your job, for example, have you experienced any bullying, physical or psychological abuse?

Answers to this question are stored in the `harass5` variable in our dataset.

12. Create a subset of the data that only contains `Yes` and `No` answers for the harassment question.
    How many responses chose each of these answers?

13. Describe how bootstrapping can be used to estimate the proportion of Americans who have been harassed by their superiors or co-workers at their job.

14. Calculate a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the proportion of Americans who have been harassed by their superiors or co-workers at their job.
    Interpret this interval in context of the data.

15. Would you expect a 90% confidence interval to be wider or narrower than the interval you calculated above?
    Explain your reasoning.

# Part 2 - Project peer review

[Available from 06/12/21]

In this part you're asked to review **three** project presentations we didn't get to watch during the presentations on Friday.
To complete this part:

-   Find the list of presentations [here](https://example.com/)

```{marginfigure}
__Note:__ You obviously cannot submit reviews for your own team (I have checks for this!).
```

16. Submit reviews for the projects using the peer review form [here](https://forms.office.com/r/qxCN5p5AEx).
    This is the same form used during the session on Friday.

17. Write a paragraph that very briefly describes each project (1-2 sentences each), highlights what you liked in each project and what you think can be improved, and finally comment on how you could improve your own project (analysis, presentation, or any other aspect) based on strengths of these three projects, if you had extra time to do so.
